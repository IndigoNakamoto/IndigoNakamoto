# Hi, I'm Indigo.

AI-Native Product Engineer | Systems Architect | Crypto-Economic Theorist | [litecoin.com/chat](https://litecoin.com/chat) |  [Citeio.com](https://citeio.com) | [litecoin.com/projects](https://litecoin.com/projects) |  [nkmag.com](https://nkmag.com)

I specialize in **high-velocity prototyping** and **secure systems architecture**. I don't just write code; I orchestrate AI agents and modern tooling to build enterprise-grade infrastructure at 10x the speed of traditional teams.

My focus is on the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence (RAG/Vector Search)** and **Decentralized Finance (UTXO Blockchains)**.

### The Philosophy: "The Architect Who Ships"
I operate as a **Force Multiplier**. By leveraging AI-native workflows (Cursor, Cline, Gemini), I handle the implementation details so I can focus on what matters: **System Design, Security, and User Experience.**

* **Velocity:** Shipped the official Litecoin AI infrastructure (35k LOC, 9 microservices) in **44 days (solo)**.
* **Security:** Architected a 7-Layer Abuse Prevention Stack (Atomic Rate Limiting, HMAC, Turnstile).
* **Reliability:** Designing for 99.9% uptime and <50ms latency.

### Featured Work

#### 1. [Litecoin Knowledge Hub](https://litecoin.com/projects/litecoin-knowledge-hub) (Official AI Assistant)
**The Enterprise RAG Platform for Litecoin.**
The official AI-powered conversational tool for the Litecoin Foundation, providing accurate, vetted answers from a trusted knowledge base. Built solo with a production-hardened RAG pipeline designed for reliability and viral traffic.
* **Status:** **Live** (Now available at litecoin.com/chat)
* **Tech:** Python (FastAPI), Next.js, Payload CMS, Redis, MongoDB Vector Search, Docker.
* **Key Features:** Conversational Memory, 7-Layer Abuse Prevention Stack, Semantic Caching, Cost-Based Throttling.
* **Live:** [litecoin.com/chat](https://litecoin.com/chat)
* **GitHub:** [Litecoin-Knowledge-Hub](https://github.com/IndigoNakamoto/Litecoin-Knowledge-Hub)

#### 2. [Citeio.com](https://citeio.com) (SaaS Product)
**Intelligent Media Analysis.**
A proprietary SaaS platform that turns long-form video/audio into a queryable knowledge base. It ingests media, generates time-coded transcripts, and enables semantic search across hours of content.
* **Status:** **Archived Showcase** (Cost-Optimized)
* **Tech:** Python, Celery, Google Gemini, Cloudflare Tunnels.
* **Key Feature:** Deep-tech data pipeline: Ingestion → Transcription → Embedding → Retrieval.
* **Scale:** Processed 1,888 files, extracted 43,693 topics, indexed 59+ days of content.

#### 3. [OrdLite.io](https://github.com/IndigoNakamoto/Litecoin-Ordinals-Explorer) (First Mover)
**The First Litecoin Ordinals Explorer.**
I **catalyzed the creation** of the Litecoin Ordinals protocol by funding the development bounty ([covered by Binance/BitcoinWorld](https://www.binance.com/en/square/post/237666)), then shipped the first explorer to visualize it.
* **Status:** **Archived** (Historical Reference)
* **Tech:** Next.js, Express (Node.js), PostgreSQL (Prisma), BTCPayServer.
* **Key Feature:** Full-stack integration of crypto payments for on-chain data storage.

#### 4. [Litecoin.com/Projects](https://litecoin.com/projects) (Ecosystem)
**Community Infrastructure.**
A clean, modern directory for managing open-source projects and donations within the ecosystem.
* **Status:** **Active / Production**
* **Tech:** Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS.
* **Impact:** Supporting 19 FOSS projects with $62,418+ raised and $54,289+ matched in donations.

### Writing & Research
Before building systems, I research the theory behind them. I have been using LLMs to synthesize complex economic and technical research since the GPT-3 Beta era.
